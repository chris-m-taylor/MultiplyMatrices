# MultiplyMatrices

This program can multiple two matrices of any size. The user can change the sizes in the javascript file and soon there will be a feature to change it on the html page.  

The output is outputted into the console so you have to check the developer tools and go to console.  

There is currently no check for what the matrix sizes are so make sure the column size of matrix1 match the row size of matrix2
